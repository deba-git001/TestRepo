This incident happend with me during one of my vacations from school...it was a friday morning.i just had my breakfast,and i was watching t.v in the living room.my parents were eating in the dining room and they were going to leave for office in sometime .after a few minutes of clanking of the spoons and the sounds from my cartoon,my parents started to talk in voices lower than usual...still i could hear them."hey, i asked my parents if they could come and stay with her while we are away."my mom said to my dad."oh..well then now  i dont see any other option than to take her with us"my dad replied."we cant...the weather at indore is too hot for her,and who is going to stay with her while we are away at the meetings?"my mom said."oh then why dont we ask her if she wants to stay at your parents house?"my dad asked my mom ."we obviously can but the propblem is they are not gonna be at home.they have to attend the wedding of one of my cousins and as i am not able to attend it my parents think it is disrespectful  if they dont attend it either"my mom replied."well my mother cant come or take care of her either"my dad said."well ofcourse not..i know your mother is not in the right health and thats okay."my mom reassured my dad."i suppose we have think about it later besides we are getting late for office"said my dad thus ending the conversation.but then i started thinking which places were more likely that my parents are going to make me stay for the rest of my vacation.a few days back my mom and dad informed me that they were to go on a buisness trip to indore together as the worked in the same company and in almost the same posts.as they were discussing,it seemed that the place where i am going to stay was not yet decided.like my mom said,my grandparents were not going to be in home and that i cannot stay with them.this was a bit of a dissapoinment for me as i enjoyed being in their company.whearas my paternal grandma lives all alone in a big house left by my grandpa[who died before i was born].she is a very old wowan whoes health is often not well.still she refuses to come and live with us.as i was thinking about all this my mom called out to me"anju,we are leaving .please dont spend all day by watching cartoons dear.bye.." "be a good girl anju"my dad said while closing the door."bye mom..bye dad"i replied...after this somehow the whole day passed and again the same scene was playing all over again only with a few changes.but now it was night and as usual i had my dinner before my parents had.
